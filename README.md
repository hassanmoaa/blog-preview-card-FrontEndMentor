### What I learned

I've had a hard time figuring out the suitable css properties for this challenge, also how to make it fully responsive but as i completed it, it gived me motivation to pursue more Front-end challenges as it sharpens my skills while doing it!

body {
    background-color: var(--Yellow-background);
    font-family: var(--ff) ;
    text-align: center;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    flex-direction: column;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
}

/*main-card*/
.card {
    background-color: var(--White-card);
    border: 1.75px solid black;
    border-radius: 20px;
    box-shadow: 7px 7px 0 1px var(--Black-text);
    margin: 100px;
    margin-bottom: 25px;
    max-width: 390px;
    height: auto;
}
